# first-person-shooter
One of my first projects from 2012, a first person shooter game.
![alt text](https://github.com/zetez/first-person-shooter/blob/master/first-person-shooter.jpg?raw=true)
A simple program with lots of bugs, using OpenGL for drawing.
Does have limited support for multiplayer by using the commands *host* and *open*.
Press **X** to close.
